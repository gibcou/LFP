Logline:
Standby is a late-in-life coming-of-age romantic drama about Matthew Holden Olsen, a socially repressed but knowledgeable 50-year-old man leaving home for the first time. Set in an airport over 24 hours, Matthew experiences life stages metaphorically through interactions with other travelers. He meets Eve, a gate agent with her own unfulfilled dreams, who becomes his love interest and guide. As Matthew confronts his fears and experiences many “firsts,” the story explores themes of anxiety, innocence, and personal growth. Both Matthew and Eve must learn to pursue their dreams and overcome their fears, potentially finding love in the process.
